# This project aims to visualize the solar system using the Plotly library in Python. It creates an interactive 3D visualization that displays the planets, their orbits around the Sun, and additional features such as Saturn's rings and small white stars in the background. The visualization allows users to explore the relative positions and sizes of the planets and gain a better understanding of the structure of our solar system. The code provided here sets up the visualization and defines the parameters for the planets, orbits, and other elements, offering a customizable and informative representation of our celestial neighborhood.
